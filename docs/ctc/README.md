# Capacitive Touch Pad Controller

This is the chip that will be handling the 24-bit matrix that makes up the gesture-pad. 24-bits because this ist he minimum number of capacitive planes that we can address to perform all of the gestures that we want to detect. This includes the 2 diagonal axes, horizontal axis, vertical, and rotational. This does *not* control the physical switches that are intended to lie below the touch pad.

It's actual function is intended to be a mixture between how navigation works on a Blackberry CT keyboard.

The touchpad is a design we're making ourselves, not a part that we are purchasing to use as is.
